[R demo](https://github.com/jbloom22/DASH/blob/master/dash.r) of the distributed association scan hammer (DASH).


This is a research prototype. DO NOT use it in any kind of production systems.

For a quick and dirty install, use `quickinstall.sh`.
With `install.sh` you can create a venv with a local install of the fork of secret-sharing.
